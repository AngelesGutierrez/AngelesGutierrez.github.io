<p><strong>Bio</strong>:</p>
<p>I have 1 brother and 2 sister I guess I count as the middle child. I'm going to be an incoming 11th grader. This year I'm going to take 7 classes and out of those 7 I'm only going to take one Ap so I won't have as much stress. Even though I'm only going to take one Ap I know I'm still going to be stressed because colleges mostly look at you 11th year grades. </p>

<p><strong>My Favorite Vacation</strong>:</p>
<p>Every year my family and friends we go to Lake Shasta. We usually rent houseboats depending on how many people are going we also rent Jet Skis, Speed Boats and paddle boats. We usually rid the boats during the day and we also swim during the day and during the night we make a campsites were we make smores.At the campsites we usually have games to play or we say jokes or the parents are just there talking about their kids.</p>
